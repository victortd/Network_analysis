# Network_analysis


The goal is to identify missing citations in a citation network of research articles. A citation network is represented as a graph G=(V, E), where the nodes correspond to scientific articles and the existence of a directed edge between nodes u and v, indicates that paper u cites paper v.

Each node (i.e., article) is also associated with information such as the title of the paper, publication year, author names and a short abstract. A number of edges have been randomly removed from the original citation network.

Your goal is to accurately reconstruct the initial network using graph-theoretical and textual features, and possibly other information.
